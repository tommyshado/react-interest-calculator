# React Interest Calculator

This project aims to simulate the banking application system using React.js to build components.

## Features

1. `Displays` the user's current bank balance.

2. `Retrieves` input from the user and `Add` to the current bank balance.

3. `Withdraws` money from the user's current bank balance.

4. Adds interest to the bank balance using a `fixed interest rate` % or a rate the user has entered in another input.

5. Deduct `bank charges` from the bank balance using a fixed amount or a percentage.
